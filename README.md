# Micro FrontEnd POC using Ara Framework

Micro FrontEnd POC using ARA framework. In this POC we have multiple React applications communicating with each other.

# Running the Application

## Start the Global App first
- cd global
- npm run dev
- Open your browser and point it to http://localhost:8080 to verify that the server has started (Don't worry if you see folder listing).

## Start the React App

- cd spa
- npm start
- The react application would render itself on browser.
